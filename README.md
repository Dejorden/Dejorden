# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Dejorden

I teach at MediaCollege Amsterdam and I also work as a freelance Developer. My company name is Andromeda Development and I make websites and Web apps.

I'm interested in:
- Laravel
- Vue
- React
- Semantic HTML
- Css
- Javascript
- Git

In the future, I hope to develop myself further as a Web/app developer and teacher so that I can help discover my students the joy that is web/app development.
